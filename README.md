#### (Ninja-Install only for Gnu/Linux*):
Open a terminal and paste this line to install the language in one command:


`
cd ~/.atom && wget https://github.com/rhoconlinux/language-do/archive/master.zip  && unzip master.zip && rm master.zip&& mv language-do-master  ~/.atom/packages/language-do && cd
`


*it might work in a mac too, cause this is a bash script, but it wasn't tested.
